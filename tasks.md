# Job Collation Module Specification

## Overview

The job collation module is a standalone system responsible for scraping job postings from multiple sources across the web and storing them in a structured database. This data will be accessible via an API that allows the main application to retrieve and use the job listings for further processing, including automated job applications.

## Scope of Work

### 1. Web Scraping Bot

- Develop a bot that scrapes job listings from specified websites using job profiles as search parameters
- Support multiple job sources with extensible architecture
- Implement scheduled periodic scraping (cron jobs/queue-based)
- Customize scraping logic per website
- Build resilience against website structure changes
- Implement anti-detection measures:
  - User-agent rotation
  - IP rotation (as needed)
  - Third-party service integration for bot detection mitigation

### 2. Data Storage

- Design optimized database schema for job listings
- Store essential job details:
  - Job Details URL (listing page)
  - Job Form URL (application page)
  - Job Title
  - Job Description/Requirements
  - Company Name
  - Company Details
  - Location
  - Job Type (Full-time/Part-time/Contract)
  - Salary (if available)
  - Date Posted
  - Source Website (Initially Indeed)
  - Additional Metadata
  - Scraping Timestamp
- Implement efficient indexing strategies

### 3. API Development

#### Job Fetching API

- RESTful API endpoints:
  - `GET /jobs` - List jobs (with pagination/filtering)
  - `GET /jobs/{id}` - Single job details
  - `GET /jobs/latest` - Recently scraped jobs
- Authentication implementation
- Response time optimization

#### Job Profile Management

- Admin endpoints:
  - `POST /jobProfileList/{profileName}` - Add profile
  - `GET /jobProfileList` - List profiles
  - `DELETE /jobProfileList` - Remove profile

### 4. Error Handling & Logging

- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Activity and error logging
- Email notifications for scraping failures

### 5. Performance & Scalability

- Efficient handling of growing job listings
- Query optimization
- Scalable scraping architecture (multi-threading/distributed)

### 6. Compliance & Ethics

- Respect robots.txt and terms of use
- Implement rate limiting
- Consider API alternatives to scraping

## Technical Requirements

### Assessment Criteria

- Modular, maintainable code structure
- Comprehensive documentation
- Git version control
- Unit and integration testing

### Technology Stack

- Backend: Node.js (Express.js) or Python (Flask/FastAPI/Django)
- Scraping: Puppeteer/Playwright (JS) or Scrapy/BeautifulSoup (Python)
- Database: PostgreSQL

### Deliverables

1. Job scraping bot
2. Database implementation
3. API with documentation
4. Logging/error handling system

## Future Improvements

- Additional source websites
- Extended job types
- New data field support
- General modifications
- DevOps requirements
- Ongoing maintenance and bug fixes
